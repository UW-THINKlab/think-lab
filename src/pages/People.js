          The THINK (Transportation-Human Interaction-and-Network Knowledge) Lab studies the sustainability
          and resilience of a city through the lens of human beings interacting with the physical environment.
          We generate new knowledge and insights for use in city planning, infrastructure development and
          policy design. Our research results facilitate real-time disaster response and recovery efforts.
          Our work is highly interdisciplinary, drawing on the latest methods and ideas in disciplines
          from social and natural sciences to engineering.

            an internationally-reknown transportation scholar. THINK lab centers around three
            inter-connected themes: travel behavior (aka human mobility) analysis, resilient
            infrastructures, and their intersections. Cynthia Chen received her Ph.D. in civil and
            environmental engineering from the University of California, Davis in 2001. Prior to
            joining UW, she taught for six years from 2003 to 2009 in the City College of New York
            as an assistant professor. â€‹Between 2017 and 2019, she served as a Program Director of
