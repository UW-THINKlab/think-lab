          <p>The work at the <span>THINK</span> (Transportation-Human Interaction-and-Network Knowledge) Lab is at
            the intersection of human behavior (in particular mobility patterns), the built environment
            and the larger infrastructure systems, and data science. Our work answers to some of the
            most important questions for this society relating to sustainability and resilience at different
            scales. More specifically, THINK lab's research activities center on unpacking complexities
            across scales, from micro-level individual mobility behaviors, to meso-scale interactions
            formed as the result of individual behaviors (whether the subject of interest is human or
            physical assets), to macro-level system behaviors that propagate through a single network
            or multiple networks.

                  We deal with infrastructure systems (transportation for example) and humans at the
                  same time, not one or the other. This is because infrastructure systems provide
                  services to humans, whose behaviors then influence the performance of infrastructure
                  systems.

                The work at THINK lab contributes in two important dimensions: science and broader impacts.

                (e.g., statistical methods, optimization, network science, data science etc.) and the
                latter can mean different things, for example, providing a solution to a real-world
                problem that will result in significant societal benefits (e.g., designing an intervention
                that will lead to more people to switch to healthier behaviors). One can make a significant

                One project (by Katie Idziorek) that the lab is working is on community resilience,
                i.e., how to leverage community residents' own resources for enhancing their own
                adaptive capacity for a disaster? We are in the first stage of the research during
                which we have conducted many focus groups, workshops and is carrying out a
                community-based survey in a number of neighborhoods. At this stage, I would say that
                the research that has been conducted so far has significant broader impacts (through
                many interactions with different communities in the region) and has not yet made a
                significant contribution in science yet. As we move this research further, we will
                expect to make scientific contributions in a number of areas including resource
                allocation (optimization) and information learning and sharing.

              <p>
                Dr. Xiangyang Guan completed his PhD dissertation on successfully developing a backward
                approach that makes no assumption on the network structure, simply takes failure
                outcome data (e.g., congestion, power blackout) as inputs to infer the underlying
                failure propagation process that gives rise to the observed phenomenon. The developed
                methodology was tested and validated in four independent cases involving transportation,
                power, epidemic and an interdependent system of transportation and power. The
                developed backward approach is a stark departure from the vast majority of the works
                in the area, which always start with a pre-determined network structure and
                propagation mechanisms and then simulate the propagation outcomes. The paper was
                published in PNAS. In this case, Dr. Guan's dissertation makes a solid contribution
                to the underlying science that is used to answer the critical question of how to
                infer propagation patterns with only failure outcome data. More specifically,
                he developed a model by integrating the state of the art from Bayesian statistics,
                network science and optimization.
